Cybersecurity graduate with a background in GRC, including risk analysis, policy development, and compliance frameworks like ISO/IEC 27001. Currently expanding my knowledge toward more technical areas such as log analysis, threat detection, SIEM operations, and cloud security fundamentals.

## Objective

I'm focused on building a well-rounded career in cybersecurity, combining a solid understanding of risk management with practical technical skills. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, take on new challenges, and apply what I learn to real-world projects.
