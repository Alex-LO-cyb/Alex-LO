Cybersecurity graduate with a background in GRC, including risk analysis, policy development, and compliance frameworks like ISO/IEC 27001. Currently expanding my knowledge toward more technical areas such as log analysis, threat detection, SIEM operations, and cloud security fundamentals. Familiar with tools like Splunk, Velociraptor, and Wireshark, and actively building a hybrid skill set combining governance and hands-on security.

## Objective

I'm focused on building a well-rounded career in cybersecurity, combining a solid understanding of risk management with practical technical skills. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, take on new challenges, and apply what I learn to real-world projects.
